# Beautiful Portland 
Beautiful Portland is a nonprofit with a mission to distribute food to Portlanders experiencing food insecurity. Now the nonprofit Beautiful Portland needs a website to better coordinate volunteers in their mission to provide hot meals to the PDX residents who need them. Potential features would include a calendar for volunteer shift signups, a volunteer database, and blast emails.

## Team Letter F
We as a team are extremely excited about our project to develop a website for the local non-profit Beautiful Portland. We recognize what a special opportunity this is for us to not only grow as developers, but also support an extremely worthy cause. To that end, we intend to deliver a product that will help Beautiful Portland focus their efforts on aiding those in need. We will further improve our abilities in software development, from requirements gathering to deployment and everything in between. We will learn to work with outside stakeholders, and navigate the non-technical issues surrounding software products. We will learn to quickly adopt new technologies and integrate them into our project when needed. Most importantly, we will learn from each other, and work as a team to fulfill our stated goals.
We would like to thank Portland State University, as well as our sponsor Beautiful Portland, for this opportunity.
