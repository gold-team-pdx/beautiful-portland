# Beautiful Portland 
Beautiful Portland is a nonprofit with a mission to distribute food to Portlanders experiencing food insecurity. Now the nonprofit Beautiful Portland needs a website to better coordinate volunteers in their mission to provide hot meals to the PDX residents who need them. Potential features would include a calendar for volunteer shift signups, a volunteer database, and blast emails.
